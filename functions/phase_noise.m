function [pn, theta] = phase_noise(num_samp, f0, dbc_per_hz, num_taps)
% This function creates noise with a 1/f spectrum. The noise is then
% phase modulated so that it can be mixed with a signal to simulate
% phase noise in the original signal. The noise is specified in power
% per hertz at frequency f0, relative to the power in the carrier.

% 1/f noise is produced by passing white noise through a filter. The
% resulting spectrum has the form
%
% Sx(w) = g^2 / w, (pretend that w is an omega)
%
% where g is the gain applied to the white noise before filtering. If P
% is the desired power in the 1 Hz. band at w0 = 2pi*f0/fs, and W is the
% 1 Hz. bandwidth in radians, we can write
%
% Notice that the result is *independent* of fs!! Look at it this way:
% if the sampling rate is doubled for a given spectrum, the new w0 is
% half the old w0. For 1/f noise, this means that Sx(w0_new) =
% 2*Sx(w0_old). But a 1 Hz. band is half as large (in radians) than it
% was previously, so the product P is the same, and fs drops out of the
% picture.
%
% The independence with respect to fs is also an indication of the
% fractal nature of pink noise.
%
% Note that the phase-modulated noise is itself 1/f if the narrowband
% assumption is valid.
